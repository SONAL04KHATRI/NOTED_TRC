👋 Hey there,
Thanks for checking out Noted!

I built this app because I wanted a simple and elegant way to manage my daily life without the hassle of complex features or distracting interfaces. Taskful is my answer to that problem, and I'm excited to share it with you.

📌 Project Overview
Taskful is a personal productivity app I developed using Swift. It’s designed to be your all-in-one hub for staying on top of your day, combining a to-do list, reminders, and a schedule into one clean, minimalistic space. My goal was to create a tool that helps you stay organized and focused on what matters, without any of the noise.

✨ Features
✅ To-Do List: A straightforward place to jot down, organize, and check off your daily tasks.

⏰ Reminders: Set custom alerts for important tasks, so you’ll never forget anything crucial.

📅 Schedule: See all your tasks laid out chronologically, giving you a clear view of your day.

🛠 Technologies Used
I built Taskful with a modern tech stack to ensure it’s fast and reliable:

Swift: The language I used for the entire app.

SwiftUI: I chose this framework to craft a clean, native-feeling user interface.

Auto Layout: To make sure the app looks great on any iPhone or iPad.

UserDefaults or CoreData: For seamless local data storage, so your tasks are always safe and accessible.
